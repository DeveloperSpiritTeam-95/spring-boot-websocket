# spring-boot-websocket

The spring-boot-websocket chat application leverages WebSocket technology to enable real-time communication between clients, such as a web browser, and the server. It facilitates instant messaging features like private and group chats, message broadcasting, and user presence notifications. This project showcases the integration of Spring Boot's WebSocket support, enabling developers to build interactive and responsive chat applications with bidirectional communication capabilities.
